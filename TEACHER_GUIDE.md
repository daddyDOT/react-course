# Teacher's Guide - React Workshop

## üìã Overview
This workshop is designed for teaching React fundamentals to beginners. The entire workshop should take approximately 3-4 hours, including hands-on practice time.

## üéØ Learning Outcomes
By the end of this workshop, students will be able to:
1. Create functional React components
2. Use JSX syntax correctly
3. Pass data between components using props
4. Style components using CSS
5. Render dynamic lists with map()
6. Manage component state with useState
7. Handle user events
8. Build a complete interactive application

## üìö Workshop Structure

### Step 1: Basic Components & JSX (20-30 minutes)
**Teaching Points:**
- What is React and why use it
- Component-based architecture
- JSX syntax vs HTML
- Function components
- Returning JSX

**Common Student Mistakes:**
- Forgetting to return a single parent element
- Using `class` instead of `className`
- Not closing self-closing tags (`<img>` ‚Üí `<img />`)
- Using `onclick` instead of `onClick`

**Suggested Activities:**
1. Show the step on screen
2. Explain each concept in the info box
3. Have students modify the component to add their own content
4. Challenge: Create a new component for a profile card

**Discussion Questions:**
- What makes React different from vanilla JavaScript?
- Why do we need a single parent element?
- What are the benefits of components?

---

### Step 2: Props (30-40 minutes)
**Teaching Points:**
- What are props and why they're needed
- Passing props to components
- Using props in components
- Props destructuring
- Making reusable components

**Common Student Mistakes:**
- Trying to modify props (they're read-only)
- Forgetting curly braces for non-string values
- Not using the correct prop names
- Confusion between props and state

**Suggested Activities:**
1. Explain the Greeting and CourseCard examples
2. Have students create their own props-based component
3. Challenge: Create a Movie or Book card with multiple props
4. Show how the same component creates different outputs

**Discussion Questions:**
- When would you use props vs hardcoded values?
- Why are props read-only?
- How do props make components reusable?

---

### Step 3: Styling (25-35 minutes)
**Teaching Points:**
- Three ways to style: CSS files, inline styles, CSS modules
- className vs class
- Inline styles as JavaScript objects
- camelCase property names
- When to use each approach

**Common Student Mistakes:**
- Using `class` instead of `className`
- Using kebab-case in inline styles (`background-color`)
- Forgetting quotes around CSS values in inline styles
- Not importing CSS files

**Suggested Activities:**
1. Show all three styling approaches
2. Have students create styled components
3. Challenge: Create a card with gradient background
4. Experiment with hover effects

**Discussion Questions:**
- When should you use inline styles vs CSS files?
- What are the pros and cons of each approach?

---

### Step 4: Lists & Mapping (35-45 minutes)
**Teaching Points:**
- Why we need to render lists dynamically
- Array.map() method review
- The key prop and its importance
- Mapping arrays to components
- Using data arrays

**Common Student Mistakes:**
- Forgetting the key prop (will see console warning)
- Using array index as key (explain why it's not ideal)
- Incorrect map syntax
- Not understanding the return value of map

**Suggested Activities:**
1. Explain the map() method with a simple example
2. Show the fruit list and student card examples
3. Have students create their own data array and map it
4. Challenge: Create a list of products with prices

**Discussion Questions:**
- Why do we need keys?
- What happens if we don't provide keys?
- When is using index as key acceptable?

---

### Step 5: State Management (40-50 minutes)
**Teaching Points:**
- What is state
- Difference between state and props
- useState hook syntax
- Updating state
- Re-rendering when state changes
- Multiple state variables

**Common Student Mistakes:**
- Trying to modify state directly (count = 5)
- Not using the setter function
- Confusion about when re-renders happen
- Forgetting to import useState

**Suggested Activities:**
1. Live code a simple counter
2. Explain each example thoroughly
3. Have students create their own stateful component
4. Challenge: Create a toggle switch or color picker

**Discussion Questions:**
- What's the difference between state and props?
- Why can't we just use regular variables?
- What triggers a re-render?

---

### Step 6: Event Handling (30-40 minutes)
**Teaching Points:**
- Common React events
- Event handler syntax
- Inline handlers vs function references
- Event object
- preventDefault()
- Controlled components

**Common Student Mistakes:**
- Calling the function immediately (onClick={func()} instead of onClick={func})
- Forgetting event parameter when needed
- Not using preventDefault on forms
- Lowercase event names (onclick vs onClick)

**Suggested Activities:**
1. Show different event types
2. Demonstrate form handling
3. Have students create a form with validation
4. Challenge: Create a calculator or quiz component

**Discussion Questions:**
- Why don't we write onclick="function()"?
- When do you need the event parameter?
- What's a controlled component?

---

### Step 7: Final Project (45-60 minutes)
**Teaching Points:**
- Combining all concepts
- Component composition
- State lifting
- Array manipulation (add, delete, update)
- Conditional rendering
- Best practices

**Suggested Activities:**
1. Walk through the Task Manager code
2. Explain each function's purpose
3. Have students add features
4. Encourage experimentation

**Extension Challenges:**
1. Add edit functionality
2. Add categories/tags
3. Add search/filter
4. Save to localStorage
5. Add priority sorting
6. Add due dates

## üí° Teaching Tips

### Before the Workshop
1. Test all steps work correctly
2. Run `npm install` and `npm run dev`
3. Have the browser console open
4. Prepare a code editor with good visibility settings
5. Have backup examples ready

### During the Workshop
1. **Go slow** - this might be their first time with React
2. **Live code** when possible, don't just show slides
3. **Encourage questions** - create a safe learning environment
4. **Use analogies** - compare React concepts to real-world objects
5. **Show errors** - demonstrate common mistakes and how to fix them
6. **Take breaks** - coding is mentally demanding
7. **Pair programming** - have students work together
8. **Check understanding** - ask questions throughout

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: "Nothing shows up on screen"**
- Check console for errors
- Verify component is imported and used in App.jsx
- Check for syntax errors

**Issue: "I get a key warning"**
- Make sure each mapped item has a unique key prop
- Explain why keys are important

**Issue: "State doesn't update"**
- Check if using the setter function
- Verify not mutating state directly

**Issue: "CSS doesn't work"**
- Check className spelling
- Verify CSS file is imported
- Check for typos in class names

### Engagement Strategies
1. **Code along**: Have students type code themselves
2. **Quick challenges**: Small tasks after each concept
3. **Show real examples**: Find React in popular websites
4. **Celebrate wins**: Praise when things work!
5. **Debugging together**: Turn errors into learning opportunities

## üìù Homework Suggestions

1. **Beginner**: Customize the Task Manager with different styling
2. **Intermediate**: Add localStorage to save tasks between sessions
3. **Advanced**: Create a new app using all concepts learned (e.g., expense tracker)

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Environment Setup Issues
- Make sure Node.js is installed (v18+)
- Run `npm install` before starting
- If port 5173 is busy, Vite will suggest another port

### Common Errors
- **Syntax Error**: Check for missing brackets, parentheses
- **Import Error**: Verify file paths and names
- **Undefined Variable**: Check spelling and scope
- **Too Many Re-renders**: State update in render (infinite loop)

---

## üìû Support

Encourage students to:
- Use browser console for errors
- Read error messages carefully
- Google error messages
- Ask questions in class
- Help each other (peer learning)

---

**Remember**: The goal is to make students comfortable with React basics and excited to learn more. Focus on understanding over speed!

Good luck with your workshop! üöÄ
